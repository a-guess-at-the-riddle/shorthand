> "The terms “prescision” and “abstraction,” which were formerly applied to every kind of separation, are now limited, not merely to mental separation, but to that which arises from attention to one element and neglect of the other. Exclusive attention consists in a definite conception or supposition of one part of an object, without anysupposition of the other. Abstraction or prescision ought to be carefully distinguished from two other modes of mental separation, which may be termed discrimination and dissociation. Discrimination has to do merely with the essences of terms, and only draws a distinction in meaning. Dissociation is that separation which, in the absence of a constant association, is permitted by the law of association of images. It is the consciousness of one thing, without the necessary simultaneous consciousness of the other. Abstraction or prescision, therefore, supposes a greater separation than discrimination, but a less separationthan dissociation. Thus I can discriminate red from blue, space from color, and color from space, but not red from color. I can prescind red from blue, and space from color (as is manifest from the fact that I actually believe there is an uncolored space between my face and the wall); but I cannot prescind color from space, nor red from color. I can dissociate red from blue, but not space from color, color from space, nor red from color."

> "Prescision is not a reciprocal process. It is frequently the case, that, while _A_ cannot be prescinded from _B_, _B_ can be prescinded from _A_. This circumstance is accounted for as follows. Elementary conceptions only arise upon the occasion of experience; that is, they are produced for the first time according to a general law, the condition ofwhich is the existence of certain impressions. Now if a conception does not reduce the impressions upon which it follows to unity, it is a mere arbitrary addition to these latter; and elementary conceptions do not arise thus arbitrarily. But if the impressions could be definitely comprehended without the conception, this latter would not reduce them to unity. Hence, the impressions (or more immediate conceptions) cannot be definitely conceived or attended to, to the neglect of an elementary conception which reduces them to unity. On the other hand, when such a conception has once been obtained, there is, in general, no reason why the premises which have occasioned it should not be neglected, and therefore the explaining conception may frequently be prescinded from the more immediate ones and from the impressions." Charles Sanders Peirce. "On a New List"

/see/

also https://www.asciiart.eu/art-and-design/geometries


### TO-DO

1. [ ] find free (open-enough copyright) SVG (if at the very least for a model example vector images):
   ** first renderset is for tetra cards **
   a. [ ] platonic solids
   b. [ ] color symbol-glyphs
   c. [ ] musical interval glyphs
   d. [ ] phoneme (word, wtf is grammatology) script characters
   
3. [ ] design an XML or similar spec via some (E)BNF-like Data Definition Language (in XML a DTD)
4. [ ] research **icon fonts** and the question of whether unicode-assignments and TeX-like keyboard-UI macros for quick entry
5. [ ] brainstorm usage cases (like rending Caley Diagrams etc) `https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cayley_table`

## Further Brainstorming...

mathematical metaphor speak ("abuse of notation")
e.g. color-quality ratio, color-quality proportion, color-quality analogy

🟩/🟪

🟩 = [ ]🟪

🟩 : 🟪 :: 🟦 : 🟨

/inductive means?/
🟩, 🟩->🟪, 🟩->🟪->🟩, … -> 🟥

 a₁, a₁+ a₂, a₁+ a₂+ a₃, …, b₁, b₁+ b₂, b₁+ b₂+ b₃ …

### SymmetricGroup(3)

```
*  a b c d e f
 +------------
a| a b c d e f
b| b a d c f e
c| c e a f b d
d| d f b e a c
e| e c f a d b
f| f d e b c a
```

`🟥 🟩 🟦 🟨 🟧 🟪  ⬛ ⬜ 🟫`

A Phenomenological "Erlangen Program"? (symmetry: invariance & change)

🟩->🟪->🟦 (invariant shape + transformation of color)

🟩->🟢->💚 (invariant color + transformation of shape)

### Hangul
The topic of Hangul's featural script and its syllable-block design is curious
here because it if we wish to make tetracards (and maybe threecards, etc.)
then we micht wish wish to embed this as a character on a computer text interface.
Of course the original design here is to use LaTeX (LuaTeX?) but exploring
textfiles is a possibility.

gesture grounding?

- def. "Gestion" (Gesture Motion)
- def. "Gestureform" ("Letterspace")
- def. "Letterform" of a "Letterspace"
- def. "Letterspace trajectory"

1. 3D gestural dynamics;
2. static 3D gesture forms;
3. shadow projections i.e. 2D letterform sets
that correspond to (2);

We can imagine a text-interface in which the mark (cursor) is placed over
a point in a text interface. Here the mark should be interpreted as being "over"
the following character. In this state the user might use something like the arrow keys
to navigate the perspective relation space (2D letterspace) of that 3D gestureform.

### Representational Strata (4 or 5 tiers)
1. (Tetra) Video clip & photographic images (not canonical but variant across writers and 'readers') of both the objects and sign-vehicle productions (gestures, phomenic gestures)
   That is writer-intended (write validation) and reader-interpretation validated
   mappings of photos to codes. For example photographs of inner-mouth phonetic gesture.
2. (Hexa) Vectorized cartoon of images of these paradigms.
3. (Octa) Miniture Logographic (Heiroglyphic-like) representations of both world and gesture, phonemic gesture.
4. (Icosa) Consonant/Vowel Alphabet
5. (Dodeca) Featural Alphabet
---

### Constellations (Rebusform)
Every gesture & alphabetic script character should mirror the Heiroglyphic iconism.
In teaching counting and adding in early child mathematics children are often taught
a standard placement of dots over the letterforms that aid in adding by counting.
With all elemental letters we might design these dots to cohere with the general constraints such that the letterform encode a diagrammatic cartoon of parts-wholes
as the image of an archetype. In short this is a fractal conceptualization that brings
another dimension of reading to a text but one that might be thought of a discerete dynamical system that what might recur through based on each letterform.

But in order to do this might we employ a graph or order theoretic lattice (e.g. Formal Concept Analysis) and if a graph what would the topology mean when one dot is next to another etc? In FCA what is represented is a whole context by means of a lattice with the contexts all-objects upper bound and all-attributes lower bound. This is quite powerful but as a fractal it would constrain the zoomspace to the natural context . If we employ a lattice we are over-constrained and will not be able to diagrammatically depict a large-enough gamut of iconic constellations. A possible compromise might be that we could employ graph coloring of edges but at current this issue is not clear.

So this concept is akin to a rebus where every letterform is itself a mnemonic-assoc icon.
