### A short aside:

####  — on Phenomenology, Taxonomy & our culture’s crystallization of unconscious reflexive habit

> “What the world was to Adam on the day he opened his eyes to it, before he had drawn any distinctions, or had become conscious of his own existence — that is first, present, immediate, fresh, new, initiative, original, spontaneous, free, vivid, conscious, and evanescent. Only, remember that every description of it must be false to it.” — _Charles Sanders Peirce \[_[ref](http://www.commens.org/dictionary/entry/quote-guess-riddle-1)_\]_

How does one re appropriate the degree of ownership over a medium? How does one dissolve the habits in the shadow of the economies of scale that come with standardization acceleration…sovereignty?

Icon Font — “_A font that exclusively contains icon glyphs rather than alphanumeric glyphs._”

[What is an icon font?](https://docs.aspose.com/font/net/what-is-font/icon-fonts/)— `[https://docs.aspose.com/font/net/what-is-font/icon-fonts/](https://docs.aspose.com/font/net/what-is-font/icon-fonts/)`

Symbolization.  
…can we make our own system of character-sized glyphs?  
…can they be assigned to html5/unicode locally uploaded by the server?

Percussive instruments like the snare drum often seem as noise, but we know that scale is important here. Rhythm/Tone duality dictates that scaling the perspective such that a noise-like rhythm is seemingly sped up brings about a rhtyhm/tone duality transitions. What is the mapping here?

### Gesture

> “**The world can only be grasped by action, not by contemplation. The hand is more important than the eye … The hand is the cutting edge of the mind.**”— Jacob Bronowski

The Hand & the Brain

> We are active; and indeed we know, as something more than a symbolic accident in the evolution of man, that it is the hand that drives the subsequent evolution of the brain. We find tools today made by man before he became man. Benjamin Franklin in 1778 called man a ‘tool-making animal’, and that is right.

> I have described the hand when it uses a tool as an instrument of discovery; it is the theme of this essay. We see it every time a child learns to couple hand and tool together — to lace its shoes, to thread a needle, to fly a kite or play a penny whistle. With the practical action there goes another, namely finding pleasure in the action for its own sake — in the skill that one perfects, and perfects by being pleased with it. This at the bottom is responsible for every work of art, and science too: our poetic delight in what human beings do because they can do it. The most exciting thing about that is that the poetic use in the end has truly profound results.

> The hand is the cutting edge of the mind. Civilization is not a collection of finished artifacts, it is the elaboration of processes. In the end, the march of man is the refinement of the hand in action.

> The most powerful drive in the ascent of man is his pleasure in his own skill. He loves to do what he does well and, having done it well, he loves to do it better. You see it in his science. You see it in the magnificence with which he carves and builds, the loving care, the gaiety, the effrontery. The monuments are supposed to commemorate kings and religions, heroes, dogmas, but in the end the man they commemorate is the builder.

### Philosophical Categories

_Aristotle —_ A brief explanation (with some alternative translations) is as follows:[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_%28Aristotle%29#cite_note-5)

1.  [**Substance**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substance_theory "Substance theory") (οὐσία, _ousia_, essence or substance).[\[6\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Categories_%28Aristotle%29#cite_note-6) _Substance_ is that which cannot be predicated of anything or be said to be in anything. Hence, _this particular man_ or _that particular tree_ are substances. Later in the text, Aristotle calls these particulars “primary substances”, to distinguish them from _secondary substances_, which are universals and _can_ be predicated. Hence, Socrates is a primary substance, while man is a secondary substance. _Man_ is predicated of Socrates, and therefore all that is predicated of man is predicated of Socrates.
2.  [**Quantity**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantity "Quantity") (ποσόν, _poson_, how much). This is the extension of an object, and may be either [discrete](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Discrete "wiktionary:Discrete") or [continuous](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Continuous "wiktionary:Continuous"). Further, its parts may or may not have relative positions to each other. All medieval discussions about the nature of the continuum, of the infinite and the infinitely divisible, are a long footnote to this text. It is of great importance in the development of mathematical ideas in the medieval and late Scholastic period. Examples: two cubits long, number, space, (length of) time.
3.  **Qualification** or [quality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quality_%28philosophy%29 "Quality (philosophy)") (ποιόν, _poion_, of what kind or quality). This determination characterizes the nature of an object. Examples: white, black, grammatical, hot, sweet, curved, straight.
4.  **Relative** (πρός τι, _pros ti_, toward something). This is the way one object may be related to another. Examples: double, half, large, master, knowledge.
5.  **Where** or [place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space "Space") (ποῦ, _pou_, where). Position in relation to the surrounding environment. Examples: in a marketplace, in the Lyceum.
6.  **When** or [time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time "Time") (πότε, _pote_, when). Position in relation to the course of events. Examples: yesterday, last year.
7.  [**Relative position**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_position "Relative position"), posture, attitude (κεῖσθαι, _keisthai_, to lie). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an action: _‘Lying’, ‘sitting’, ‘standing’._ Thus _position_ may be taken as the end point for the corresponding action. The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the relative position of the parts of an object (usually a living object), given that the position of the parts is inseparable from the state of rest implied.
8.  **Having** or state, [condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condition_%28philosophy%29 "Condition (philosophy)") (ἔχειν, _echein_, to have or be). The examples Aristotle gives indicate that he meant a condition of rest resulting from an affection (i.e. being acted on): _‘shod’, ‘armed’._ The term is, however, frequently taken to mean the determination arising from the physical accoutrements of an object: one’s shoes, one’s arms, etc. Traditionally, this category is also called a _habitus_ (from Latin _habere_, to have).
9.  **Doing** or [action](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Action_%28philosophy%29 "Action (philosophy)") (ποιεῖν, _poiein_, to make or do). The production of change in some other object (or in the agent itself _qua_ other).
10.  **Being affected** or [affection](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection_%28philosophy%29 "Affection (philosophy)") (πάσχειν, _paschein_, to suffer or undergo). The reception of change from some other object (or from the affected object itself _qua_ other). Aristotle’s name _paschein_ for this category has traditionally been translated into English as “affection” and “passion” (also “passivity”), easily misinterpreted to refer only or mainly to [affection as an emotion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Affection "Affection") or to [emotional passion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Passion_%28emotion%29 "Passion (emotion)"). For action he gave the example, _‘to lance’, ‘to cauterize’;_ for affection, _‘to be lanced’, ‘to be cauterized.’_ His examples make clear that action is to affection as the active voice is to the passive voice — as _acting_ is to _being acted on_.

> “An **electrical network** is an interconnection of electrical components (e.g., batteries, resistors, inductors, capacitors, switches, transistors) or a model of such an interconnection, consisting of electrical elements(e.g., voltage sources, current sources, resistances, inductances, capacitances). An **electrical circuit** is a network consisting of a closed loop, giving a return path for the current. Thus all circuits are networks, but not all networks are circuits (although networks without a closed loop are often imprecisely referred to as “circuits”).”

> “The circuit breaker must first detect a fault condition. In small mains and low-voltage circuit breakers, this is usually done within the device itself. Typically, the heating or magnetic effects of electric current are employed. Circuit breakers for large currents or high voltages are usually arranged with protective relay pilot devices to sense a fault condition and to operate the opening mechanism. These typically require a separate power source, such as a battery, although some high-voltage circuit breakers are self-contained with current transformers, protective relays, and internal power sources.

> Once a fault is detected, the circuit breaker contacts must open to interrupt the circuit; this is commonly done using mechanically stored energy contained within the breaker, such as a spring or compressed air to separate the contacts. A breaker may also use the higher current caused by the fault to separate the contacts, via thermal expansion or increased magnetic field. A small circuit breakers typically has a manual control lever to switch the circuit off or reset a tripped breaker, while a larger unit may use a solenoid to trip the mechanism, and an electric motor to restore energy to springs (which rapidly separate contacts when the breaker is tripped).

> The circuit breaker contacts must carry the load current without excessive heating, and must also withstand the heat of the arc produced when interrupting (opening) the circuit. Contacts are made of copper or copper alloys, silver alloys and other highly conductive materials. Service life of the contacts is limited by the erosion of contact material due to arcing while interrupting the current. Miniature and molded-case circuit breakers are usually discarded when the contacts have worn, but power circuit breakers and high-voltage circuit breakers have replaceable contacts.

> When a high current or voltage is interrupted, an arc is generated. The maximum length of the arc is generally proportional to the voltage while the intensity (or heat) is proportional to the current. This arc must be contained, cooled and extinguished in a controlled way, so that the gap between the contacts can again withstand the voltage in the circuit. Different circuit breakers use vacuum, air, insulating gas, or oil as the medium the arc forms in. Different techniques are used to extinguish the arc including:

> Lengthening or deflecting the arc

> Intensive cooling (in jet chambers)

> Division into partial arcs

> Zero-point quenching (contacts open at the moment in the [AC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternating_current "Alternating current") waveform at which the current and potential are near zero, effectively breaking no load current at the time of opening. The zero-crossing occurs at twice the line frequency; i.e., 100 times per second for 50 Hz and 120 times per second for 60 Hz AC.)

> Connecting capacitors in parallel with contacts in DC circuits.

> Finally, once the fault condition has been cleared, the contacts must again be closed to restore power to the interrupted circuit.”

  

Douglas Flemmon’s Completing Distinctions

> “Any act of knowing, any knowing act, begins with the drawing of a distinction, with the noting of a difference. A boundary is created when a whole is distinguished from a part of itself — as in ecosystem/species, paragraph/sentence, family/ child — or when a part of a whole is simply differentiated from another part — as in foreground/background, yesterday/ tomorrow, husband/wife. The relationship formed by such acts of demarcation constitute the “stuff” of mind. Knowing is composed of boundaries imposed.” _(Douglas Flemmons._ Completing Distinctions_)_

  

> “A universe comes into being when a space is severed or taken apart. By tracing the way we represent such a severance, we can begin to reconstruct, with an accuracy and coverage that appear almost uncanny, the basic forms underlying linguistic, mathematical, physical, and biological science, and can begin to see how the familiar laws of our own experience follow inexorably from the original act of severance.” — **G. Spencer-Brown**

  

> “The Taoists and Buddhists were perhaps the first to recognize that in the marking of a difference, the boundary that separates the two sides of the created distinction necessarily connects them. … A most interesting conceptual tool spirals into form if this instance of distinctive understanding is allowed to pivot on itself. The distinction connection/separation describes the doubleness of the relation between the two sides of a difference, and in so doing it comments on itself, as it connects and separates connection and separation.” _(_**_Douglas Flemmons._ Completing Distinctions**_)_

“The table below \[above\] offers an outline of the principal characteristics of the nine types along with their basic relationships. This table expands upon Oscar Ichazo’s ego fixations, holy ideas, passions, and virtues\[ primarily using material from _Understanding the Enneagram: The Practical Guide to Personality Types_ (revised edition) by Don Richard Riso and Russ Hudson as well as Charles Tart’s _Transpersonal Psychologies_. Other theorists may disagree on some aspects. The types are normally referred to by their numbers, but sometimes their “characteristic roles” (which refers to distinctive archetypal characteristics) are used instead. Various labels for each type are commonly used by different authors and teachers. The “stress” and “security” points (sometimes referred to as the “disintegration” and “integration” points) are the types connected by the lines of the enneagram figure and are believed to influence a person in an adverse or relaxed circumstance. According to this hypothesis, someone with a primary One type, for example, may begin to think, feel, and act more like someone with a Four type when stressed or a Seven type when relaxed.” — (`[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Nine_types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enneagram_of_Personality#Nine_types))`

### Erlangen Programming / Symmetry / Group Theory

- - -

> “These were the first leaks in a dam that had been holding back human  
> thought. The next decades saw a flood of research in geometry and the  
> creation of a great profusion of geometric systems. The traditional meaning of geometry could not encompass the new wealth of phenomena. A revised understanding of the nature of geometry was urgently needed.

> The basis for this new understanding came from a subject invented at nearly the same time as non-Euclidean geometry — the theory of groups. Unlike the questions surrounding the Fifth Postulate which were in the minds of many mathematicians at the time, group theory was the invention of one extraordinary individual, Evariste Galois.

> Galois was too smart for his own good. A student revolutionary who once  
> toasted the king of France by burying a knife in a table, he died in a duel  
> over a woman at the age of twenty-two. That was in 1832, the same year  
> as Bolyai’s publication on non-Euclidean geometry. Fortunately for mathematics, Galois spent the night before the duel furiously writing down his  
> ideas about groups and their applications to solving polynomial equations.  
> Galois’ ideas were hard for his contemporary mathematicians to understand.  
> However, they did get studied and appreciation for their power gradually  
> percolated through the mathematical community during the same period  
> when geometric research was roaring full throttle. Indeed, a realization of  
> the relevance of group theory to geometry began to grow, with groups arising  
> from symmetries — transformations of a system which preserve the essential  
> characteristics of the system.

> The seminal connection between geometry and group theory was discovered by Felix Klein. It was the custom in German universities of that era for new professors to give an inaugural lecture on their research to the full faculty. In 1872, at the University of Erlanger, Felix Klein, then only twenty-three years old, presented to his colleagues striking ideas about how to unify geometry by means of symmetry via group theory. This proposal has become known as Klein’s **Erlanger Programme**. Klein’s first observation was that geometry is not about individual figures but about classes of equivalent figures. For example, in Euclidean geometry there is a notion of congruence. Any two congruent figures are “the same” from the point of view of Euclidean geometry — they have the same geometric properties. Furthermore, you can tell if two figures are congruent by transforming or moving one so that it becomes (more correctly, coincides with) the other. The transformation you use should be a rigid motion, i.e., it should preserve distances and angles.

> Thus, at the core of Euclidean geometry, as well as at the core of most  
> other geometries constructed after 1830, there was a notion of geometric  
> equivalence, defined by a specified collection of transformations known as the symmetries of the geometry. (In Euclid’s Elements, this idea was somewhat hidden and never explicitly acknowledged, but the attentive reader can see it used at certain critical places.) Klein further observed that

>  — (i) the set of symmetries formed a group in the sense of Galois and  
>  — (ii) you can reconstruct the geometry from its symmetry group.

> In short, the fundamental idea in geometry is that of symmetry, and a given  
> geometry is governed by the nature of its symmetries.”
