 Field, J. V. _Kepler's Geometrical Cosmology_

> "The terms “prescision” and “abstraction,” which were formerly applied to every kind of separation, are now limited, not merely to mental separation, but to that which arises from attention to one element and neglect of the other. Exclusive attention consists in a definite conception or supposition of one part of an object, without anysupposition of the other. Abstraction or prescision ought to be carefully distinguished from two other modes of mental separation, which may be termed discrimination and dissociation. Discrimination has to do merely with the essences of terms, and only draws a distinction in meaning. Dissociation is that separation which, in the absence of a constant association, is permitted by the law of association of images. It is the consciousness of one thing, without the necessary simultaneous consciousness of the other. Abstraction or prescision, therefore, supposes a greater separation than discrimination, but a less separationthan dissociation. Thus I can discriminate red from blue, space from color, and color from space, but not red from color. I can prescind red from blue, and space from color (as is manifest from the fact that I actually believe there is an uncolored space between my face and the wall); but I cannot prescind color from space, nor red from color. I can dissociate red from blue, but not space from color, color from space, nor red from color."

> "Prescision is not a reciprocal process. It is frequently the case, that, while _A_ cannot be prescinded from _B_, _B_ can be prescinded from _A_. This circumstance is accounted for as follows. Elementary conceptions only arise upon the occasion of experience; that is, they are produced for the first time according to a general law, the condition ofwhich is the existence of certain impressions. Now if a conception does not reduce the impressions upon which it follows to unity, it is a mere arbitrary addition to these latter; and elementary conceptions do not arise thus arbitrarily. But if the impressions could be definitely comprehended without the conception, this latter would not reduce them to unity. Hence, the impressions (or more immediate conceptions) cannot be definitely conceived or attended to, to the neglect of an elementary conception which reduces them to unity. On the other hand, when such a conception has once been obtained, there is, in general, no reason why the premises which have occasioned it should not be neglected, and therefore the explaining conception may frequently be prescinded from the more immediate ones and from the impressions." Charles Sanders Peirce. "On a New List"

### ICON SET:
1. ascii identifier
2. aspect projection
3. object vs attribute duality?
4. larger diagrammatic embedding (e.g. Caley tables)?

### (ASCII-mode)?
https://asciidiagrams.github.io/
also https://www.asciiart.eu/art-and-design/geometries


### TO-DO

1. [ ] find free (open-enough copyright) SVG (if at the very least for a model example vector images):
   ** first renderset is for tetra cards **
   a. [ ] platonic solids
   b. [ ] color symbol-glyphs
   c. [ ] musical interval glyphs
   d. [ ] phoneme (word, wtf is grammatology) script characters
   
3. [ ] design an XML or similar spec via some (E)BNF-like Data Definition Language (in XML a DTD)
4. [ ] research **icon fonts** and the question of whether unicode-assignments and TeX-like keyboard-UI macros for quick entry
5. [ ] brainstorm usage cases (like rending Caley Diagrams etc)
