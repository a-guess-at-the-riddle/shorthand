# shorthand
A shorthand markup language and UI API for rendering into various mediums.

TO-DO

1. find free (open-enough copyright) SVG (if at the very least for a model example vector images)
2. design an XML or similar spec via some (E)BNF-like Data Definition Language (in XML a DTD)
3. research **icon fonts** and the question of whether unicode-assignments and TeX-like keyboard-UI macros for quick entry
4. brainstorm usage cases (like rending Caley Diagrams etc)
